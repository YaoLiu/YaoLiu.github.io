I am a Lecturer at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, starting July 2024. Concurrently, I hold an Honorary Lecturer position at the School of Computing, Macquarie University, Australia. My research centers on computer vision and deep learning, with a focus on spatio-temporal data modeling and analysis. Key areas include medical imaging, 3D point clouds, trajectory prediction, UAV image and video detection, and human action recognition.

Since January 2024, I have been a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the School of Computing, Macquarie University, working under the supervision of Prof. Lina Yao and Prof. Quan Z. Sheng (Michael). I completed my Ph.D. as part of the Data Dynamics group at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales (UNSW), from 2020 to 2023. My doctoral research was supervised by Prof. Lina Yao, with A/Prof. Binghao Li as a joint supervisor.

Before academia, I worked as a Software Engineer at Cloud & AI, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., from 2019 to 2020. I earned my M.S. (2019) and B.S. (2016) degrees from the GIS Lab, School of Earth Sciences, Zhejiang University, under the guidance of A/Prof. Feng Zhang, Prof. Zhenhong Du, and Prof. Renyi Liu.
